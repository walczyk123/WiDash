ðŸ“¡ **WiDash â€“ ESP8266 WiFi Dashboard for Sensor Monitoring**  
WiDash is a lightweight web-based dashboard running on an ESP8266 that provides real-time monitoring of sensor data over your local WiFi network. The main focus of this project is to offer a dashboard for displaying sensor readings, such as temperature from a **DS18B20** digital temperature sensor.

The data is presented through a simple HTML interface accessible via a web browser on the local network. Additionally, WiDash offers secondary features like WiFi network scanning, connection management, and a serial debug menu for advanced users.

> âœ… **No need for any external upload tools** â€“ all HTML views are embedded directly into the firmware as `.h` files and served from flash memory.
